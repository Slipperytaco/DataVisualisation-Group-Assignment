(a) The NOM estimates in this table use the 12/16 month rule methodology for calculating NOM. They have not been used in compiling Australia's official estimated resident population (ERP) until September quarter 2006 and onwards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(b) To confidentialise, estimates have been rounded to the nearest 10. As a result, sums of the components may not add exactly to totals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(c) The visa information in this table represents the number of visas based on the visa type at the time of a traveller's specific movement. It is this specific movement that has been used to calculate NOM. Therefore, the number of visas in this table should not be confused with information on the number of visas granted by the Department of Home Affairs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(d) NOM arrivals are all overseas arrivals that contribute to net overseas migration (NOM). It is the number of incoming international travellers who stay in Australia for 12 months or more, who are not currently counted within the population, and are then added to the population.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(e) NOM departures are all overseas departures that contribute to net overseas migration (NOM). It is the number of outgoing international travellers (Australian residents and long-term visitors to Australia) who leave Australia for 12 months or more, who are currently counted within the population, and are then subtracted from the population.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(f) Includes Other Territories.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
